**Review by**

Aadesh Anil Madnaik 2022 (BTech.)

**Course Offered In** 
Spring 2022 (Jan-Apr 2022)

**Instructors**
Profs D Manjunath & Jayakrishnan Nair

**Prerequisites**

Basic Probability course like EE325

**Difficulty**

On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being easiest, **1**

**Course Content**

Bandit algorithms, sampling, regret for adversarial, stochastic and Markovian bandits, Thompson Sampling - slides linked [[here]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15D0JQRPlzu04DQwFFn6BpWrswi6K2gRi?usp=sharing)

**Feedback on Lectures**

The lectures were quite good overall. Both professors teach well and
expect good engagement from the students. The subject taught is fairly
easy to understand particularly if you have prior experience with bandit
theory from CS747 or any online learning course. The lectures dealt with
details of bandit algorithms, formulations of regret, and evaluating
policies. It is notable that this course does NOT cover MDPs.

**Feedback on Evaluations**

Only one mode of evaluation - take-home endsem with 100% weightage

The professors were about to place certain weightage on class
interaction, but they removed it after midsem.

**Study Material and References**

Slides linked [[here]{.ul}](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15D0JQRPlzu04DQwFFn6BpWrswi6K2gRi?usp=sharing)

**Follow-up Courses**

Any other courses on online learning, including MDPs will be a good
follow-up to this

**Final Takeaways**

This is a very interesting course and the professors certainly teach it
well. The course content is highly important for online learning.
