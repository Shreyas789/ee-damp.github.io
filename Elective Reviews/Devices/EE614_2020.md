**Feedback on Lectures**

The professor used to teach via his recorded lectures on NPTEL. He didn’t teach via slides or board. Even though the lectures were available on the NPTEL, the attendance was kept mandatory and for <75% he said to award a DX grade. The lectures were quite easy to follow. The only problem was asking doubts as the professor used to take all the doubts at the end of the video so interactive doubt clearing was not possible.

**Feedback on Evaluations**

The professor conducted the regular tutorial sessions. These sessions were very helpful as you can easily get your doubts cleared during these sessions. The questions asked in the exams were similar to or indirectly related to the tutorials. The professor conducted one quiz and midsem(rest was not done due to COVID). The midsem was moderately difficult and the quiz was easy.
