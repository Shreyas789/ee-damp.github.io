**Feedback on lectures:**
Attendance constituted 20% marks with max 5 holidays allowed, so attending lectures was a must thing. Lectures were taught using slides which were shared after the class. Prof. Munish Chandel taught this course and he is a very student-friendly and kind hearted teacher. Attending classes were never boring as he always used to teach relating with stories and funny incidents. The content was simple and consisted basic terminologies of environmental studies.

**Feedback on assignments, tutorials and exam:**
There were no tutorials. Attendance was compulsory with 20% marks, end term was of 35% and midterm was of 25% with two quizzes of 5% each. 10% was allotted to term paper and its presentation.

Quizzes were objective while midterm and endterm included both objective and subjective questions. Exam difficulty level was easy and only slides needed to be referred for preparation. There were no tutorials.
