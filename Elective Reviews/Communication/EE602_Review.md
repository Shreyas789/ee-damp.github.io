* Course Offered In

Spring, 2021-22



* Instructors

Prof. Kushal Tuckley



* Prerequisites

There are no such hard prerequisites. But, having good knowledge about EE301 (Electromagnetic Waves) and EE229 (Signal Processing - I) will be helpful.



* Difficulty

3 (on a scale of 1-5 with 5 being very tough)



* Course Content
1. Radar Basics - Range and Velocity Measurement for Pulsed Radars, Propagation of Radar Signals
2. Understanding Radar Design parameters - The Radar Equation, Receiver Sensitivity, Noise, SNR, Probability of Detection, Radar Cross-Section
3. Continuous Wave Radars - Linear FMCW Radars, Range and Doppler Measurement in FMCW radars
4. Transmitters, Duplexers and Circulators 
5. Antennas used in Radar Systems - Effect of Aperture Illumination, Beam steering, Digital beam forming
6. Receivers - Matched filter detection, Pulse compression
7. Tracking with Radars
8. Navigational and Strategic applications of Radars
9. Digital realization of radar sub-systems
* Feedback on Lectures

Lectures were held in online mode. They are a bit slow-paced in the first half, but later speed up. Prof. Tuckley is very energetic during the lectures and tries to involve the students in discussions. He has great knowledge about the topics as he himself is involved in the modern radar industry. 

The slides are good and they also include some extra material. Attending the lectures and taking notes regularly will help in getting a good grade.



* Feedback on Evaluations

Two quizzes were taken and the best one was considered for 10% weightage. The Midsem and Endsem exams carried 25% and 40% weightage respectively. Going through the lecture notes and practice problems provided by Prof. will be very helpful for these exams.

In addition to this, there was a presentation assignment for 25% weightage (5% for report and 20% for PPT) in which we had to review a paper, provided by Prof. or any allied topic associated with radars. The presentations were in groups of 3-4. He expects a detailed discussion on the topic in the QnA session.



* Study Material and References

In addition to slides, Prof. Tuckley provides lecture notes on each chapter. They contain numerical problems for each chapter. The material provided by Prof. is sufficient. But, if someone wants to explore more, these books will be helpful :
