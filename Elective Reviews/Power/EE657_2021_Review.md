**Review by**
Immanuel Williams, EE DD PEPS 2018-2023

**Course Offered In**
Autumn 2021


**Instructors**
Prof. Kishore Chatterjee

**Prerequisites**
Officially, no requisites. The first half of the course which deals with DC motor drives has some parts which are essentially a repeat of EE238.


**Difficulty**
The course is not a difficult course. The level of difficulty is similar to that of EE238 but slightly higher.

**Course Content**
Methods of DC motor control, non-regenerative controlled rectifiers, fully controlled converters, field control, switching systems for DC motors, chopper regulators, aspects of analysis, performance and stability of variable speed dc drives.; Induction motor control systems, ac regulators and static switches, control of effective rotor resistance, recovery of slip energy, variable frequency control of ac motors, current source inverter fed Induction motor drive, forced commutated inverter fed drives, self-controlled synchronous motor drives and traction drives. Analysis, performance and stability of synchronous and asynchronous drives. solar and battery powered drives.

 
**Feedback on Lectures**
The lectures are really useful. It is important to take notes as the slides only provide the bare minimum information whereas the instructor likes to teach in the traditional blackboard method.

**Feedback on Evaluations**
The exams for this course are very easy to crack as they are similar or repeated in nature. One can expect similar sets of questions in the final exams as some of the quizzes.

**Study Material and References**
For this course, it is important to take notes, even if the slides are provided for the same.


**Follow-up Courses**
EE656 (Electric Machine Analysis and Control), a strongly recommended course if there is a genuine interest in electric drives. EE653 (Power Electronics - I) should be done in tandem with this course and EE673 (Power Electronics and Power Systems Lab) will give some practical insights into the theory taught in this course.


**Final Takeaways**

This course is an introductory level course on electrical machines. The basic principles of electric drives are covered without going into too much detail into the models of the machines themselves, while setting the ground for EE656 where the machine model is further analysed.
