Prof Sandeep Anand

**Prerequisites**
Power electronics course 1 and 2

**Difficulty**
5/5  difficult

**Course Content**
Content is useful for students deeply interested in power electronics (planning to do some project in field). It is also available on ASC.

Introduction to renewable sources: world energy scenario, Wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, availability and power extraction. Introduction to solar energy: Photovoltaic effect, basics of power generation, P-V & I-V characteristics, effect of insolation, temperature, diurnal variation, shading; Modules, connections, ratings; Power extraction (MPP), tracking and MPPT schemes; standalone systems, grid interface, storage, AC-DC loads. Power converters for solar: Micro converter, DC-DC buck/boost/buck-boost /flyback /forward/cuk, bidirectional converters; Inverters: 1ph, 3ph inverters with & w/o xâ€™mer, Heric, H6, Multilevel Neutral point clamp, Modular multilevel, CSI; Control schemes: unipolar, bipolar, PLL and synchronization, power balancing / bypass, Parallel power processing; Grid connection issues: leakage current, Islanding, harmonics, active/reactive power feeding, unbalance. Intro to wind energy: P-V, I-V characteristic, wind power system: turbine-generator-inverter, mechanical control, ratings; Power extraction (MPP) and MPPT schemes. Generators for wind: DC generator with DC to AC converters; Induction generator with & w/o converter; Synchronous generator with back to back controlled/ uncontrolled converter; Doubly fed induction generator with rotor side converter topologies; permanent magnet based generators. Battery: Types, charging discharging. Introduction to AC and DC microgrids

 
**Feedback on Lectures**
All lectures are available on youtube. Basic power electronics knowledge is expected to understand course, explanation by prof is very good for each topic.

**Feedback on Evaluations**
There were 4 quizzes and endsem. Questions were hard and checking was also hard.



**Study Material and References**
Sir did not refer to any particular book. Content was from different sources. Some text book references are available on ASC.


**Follow-up Courses**
NA


**Final Takeaways**
Course mostly focuses on applications. If you are good at power electronics then you this course will teach you how to apply previous knowledge.  This course is one step advance than basic courses. Content of course is really good and helpful while doing advance projects.  You will get to know some of the new concept and research going in Power electronics. 
Finally course is good if your basics are good.
