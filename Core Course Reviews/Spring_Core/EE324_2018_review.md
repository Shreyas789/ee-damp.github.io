**Review by**

**Course Offered In**
Spring 2018


**Instructors**
Prof Debraj Chakraborty

**Prerequisites**
EE 302(in parallel)

**Difficulty**
Moderate mainly due to the excess time spent in calibration and obtaining the desired result.

**Course Content**
Goal is to gain practical experience about the concepts taught in EE302 Control Systems course.
The lab had 3 experiments, each 2 week long, with lab on alternate weeks, throughout the semester. A fourth experiment was proposed but was later scrapped due to technical and time constraints. A few theory lectures were held as well to supplement the labs.
 
**Feedback on Lab**
The first experiment was motor control, second was line follower using PID and the third one was inverted pendulum. The theory related to the experiments was covered in a theory lecture. The theory used in lab is covered later in EE302 hence the lectures were needed. The experiments consisted of calibration, tuning of parameters and simple microcontroller coding. Calibration of the values and tuning of parameters took up a lot of time and were the major bottleneck in completing an experiment. Due to this, the experiments were time consuming and extra sessions were often required to finish an experiment. A report was to be submitted post each experiment, and viva was taken. There were no exams or quizzes for this course. Grading was based on the report, viva and experiment completion.

**Feedback on Evaluations**
The grading was largely dependent on the TA assigned, who graded the viva and report.
