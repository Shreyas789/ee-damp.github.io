**Course Offered In**
Spring 2017


**Instructors**
Prof Madhu Belur, Prof Debraj Chakraborty

**Prerequisites**
EE 302 (in parallel)

**Difficulty**
Moderate mainly due to lots of time spent in calibration and obtaining the desired result.

**Course Content**
Goal of the lab is to gain practical experience about the concepts taught EE302 Control Systems course.
The lab had 3 experiments, each 2 week long, with lab on alternate weeks, throughout the semester. A few theory lectures were held as well to supplement the labs.

 
**Feedback on Lab**
The first experiment was motor control, second was line follower using PID and the third one was inverted pendulum. The theory related to the experiments was covered in a theory lecture the previous week. The experiments were mostly calibration and simple coding. Calibration of the values took up a lot of time. A report was to be submitted post each experiment, and viva was also taken. No exams or quizzes were taken. Grading was based purely on the report, viva and experiment completion.

**Feedback on Evaluations**
The grading was largely dependent on the TA assigned, who graded the viva and report.
