### EE 328 – DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS



**Course offered in:**



Spring 2014



**Instructors:**



Prof. Shabbir Merchant



**Course Content:**



1.Review of Random Processes and Spectral analysis.

2.Elements of Detection Theory. Optimum detection of signals in noise

3.Coherent communication with waveforms- Probability of Error evaluations.

4.Baseband Pulse Tranmission- Intersymbol Interference and Nyquist criterion.

5.Passband Digital Modulation schemes- Phase Shift Keying, Frequency Shift Keying, Quadrature Amplitude Modulation, Continous Phase Modulation and Minimum Shift Keying.

6.Digital Modulation tradeoffs.Optimum demodulation of digital signals over bandlimited channels- Maximum likelihood sequence detection


**Prerequisites:**



EE 308 is a course pre requisite for EE328. And more important this course would be one of the pre-requisites for many courses in future taken as department electives in communication field.



**Feedback on Lectures:**

Lectures were really good. We had video lectures recorded for cdeep so even if you miss a lecture then you catch up. Professor followed almost all things from textbook. Video lectures and slides were helpful in the end. (at the time of exams)

Attendance was not compulsory. (Many people managed to just watch video lectures and didn’t bother to go to classes.)

Professor gave just only one assignment. But he used to mark some questions from Haykin’s book for each chapter covered in the class as a tutorial. He also used to solve some of this questions in tutorial hours. These questions were important to get basics clear.

If you have gone through all lecture slides and marked tutorial questions , then you can do good  his exams. Exams were based to check your concepts and fundamentals.


**Difficulty:**



Moderate



**Grading Statistics:**


Moderate



**Study Material and References:**



Simon Haykin , “Digital Communications”


**Takeaways from the course:**


Any course in future in communication field will require basics covered in this course. EE708 , information theory and coding and wireless networks would be good courses to do if you liked this course.
