### EE 308 – COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS


**Course offered in:**


2013-14

**Instructors:**

Prof. Abhay Karandikar

**Motivation behind the course:**

This is the first introductory course of communication area in IIT Bombay undergraduate curriculum. If you have ever wondered how does AM or FM works, then this course will definitely help you. This course is fundamental course and will give you glimpse of analog communication, digital communication, information theory & coding and today’s wireless technology.

Communication systems (EE308) in parallel with Probability and Random Process (EE325) will lead to foundation of basic concepts required as a communication engineer.

**Course Content:**


This is brief outline of course content

1.Amplitude Modulation:

Double side band (DSB)

Single side band (SSB)

Vestigial side band (VSB)

2.  Angle Modulation:

Frequency and Phase Modulation

Demodulation of FM

Interference in FM

3. Sampling and Pulse Modulation:

Pulse code modulation (PCM) , DPCM, ADPCM, Delta modulation, Pulse Amplitude modulation, ISI, Nyquist criterion, Multiplexing

4. Introduction to Information theory and coding

5. Mathematical Representation of noise, Review of random process, power spectral density, Noise in AM and FM

6.Introduction to wireless communication system


**Prerequisites:**


Officially there is no pre-requisite but concepts covered in EE210 signals and systems would be useful. And more important this course would be one of the pre-requisites for many advanced courses in communication field.


**Feedback on Lectures:**

Lectures were really good. If you concentrate in lecture and take notes, then you can easily score good in this course. Reading reference books will be useful if you want deeper insight in concepts covered in class. 80 % attendance was compulsory. Professor was a little bit strict about attendance. But keep in mind that don’t be late for his lectures.

**Feedback on Tutorials, Assignments and Exams:**

Assignments were given for important topics discussed in the class. Submitting assignments was compulsory even though they didn’t carry any marks. All assignments will check your fundamentals and concepts.

Exams were based to test your understanding of subject. Quiz 1 and Midsem were pretty easy just based on conceptual understanding and assignments. But afterwards difficulty level was increased.


**Difficulty:**

Difficulty level : Moderate


**Grading:**

Moderate


**Study Material and References:**

Textbooks and reference books:

Simon Haykin , “ Principles of Communication Systems”

H. Taub, DL Schilling , “ Principles of Communication Systems”


**Advanced courses and applications of this course in future:**

Any course in future in communication field will require basics covered in this course. Digital communication is a compulsory course which will require this course as pre requisite.

EE708 , information theory and coding and wireless communication would be good courses to do if you liked this course. If you want to take up some projects in this field then this is a good  introduction.
