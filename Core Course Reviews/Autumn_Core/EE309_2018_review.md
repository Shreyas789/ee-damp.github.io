**Difficulty**
NA 

**Course Content**
By the end of the course, one should : 

- Understand the basic building blocks which make up a simple microprocessor and various techniques boosting up the efficiency 
- Be able to optimize the resources used and be able to make the microprocessor more efficient using logical and rational methods
- Understand various other functionalities of basic microprocessors like 8085 and 8051 along with their instructions, opcodes etc
- Build a pipelined (a much more efficient microprocessor than many basic ones) processor using VHDL programming language 

 The course starts with some description about Instruction Set Architecture and some basic microprocessors like 8051 and 8085 with their instructions. This is followed by concepts such as timers, interrupts, memory and keyboard interfacing. The second half of the course covered CISC and RISC (single and multi cycles) architectures and ended with pipelining architecture and a more concise description of cache memory. 
**Feedback on Lectures**

**Feedback on Evaluations**
The professor takes weekly quizzes which account to around 20% of the weightage, a 10 marks midsem with a weightage of 10%, a 30 mark endsem with a weightage of 30%, two course projects for 30% along with an assignment for 10%. 

The exams were very challenging, the professor allows open notes and gives unlimited time.
