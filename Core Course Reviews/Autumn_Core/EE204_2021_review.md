**Feedback on Lectures:**

The lectures were well planned, and the slides provided by Sir were pretty comprehensive.
Ours was a covid batch; therefore, lectures were made available on youtube, and weekly doubt clearing sessions were conducted by Sir. In an offline scenario, I strongly recommend attending lectures as Sir teaches enthusiastically and practical aspects are sometimes demonstrated too.

**Feedback on Evaluations:**

The evaluation consisted of –
- Weekly quizzes(42%) – were fast-paced, and speed along with accuracy played a crucial role for scoring in these. Regularity is the key to attain decent marks in them
- Midsem(25%) and Endsem(33%) – Both consisted of two parts comprising of an objective and a subjective paper. Objective paper tested analytical skills, and in subjective paper sometimes theory right off the slides were asked.

Overall, the exams were of mediocre difficulty level, and a good understanding of the material is required to achieve a good grade. Sometimes incentives such as bonus marks were provided for attending lectures. Weekly tutorials were also conducted to discuss the quiz
