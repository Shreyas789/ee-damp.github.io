### EE 308 – COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (DD)


**Course offered in:**

2019-20

**Instructors:**

Prof. Shabbir N Merchant (For EE B.Tech)

**Motivation:**

This course is the first proper introductory course to communication systems in our curriculum at IIT Bombay. All those comm. enthu people, mark this course for your semester. This course concentrates on Analog Communication Systems, and Digital Communication Systems are left for the EE328 course in the 6th Semester. If you have ever wondered what the theory and math behind the working of AM/FM Radios is, this the course for you. 

**Course Content:**

The topics covered in this course are as follows –

Selective Review of Signals and Systems (Only the Continuous Fourier Transform part)
Principles of Analog Modulation – Modulation and Demodulation of AM
Hilbert Transform
Double Sideband – Suppressed Carrier , Single Side Band signals and their practical applications
Bandpass systems and Band-limited signals
Vestigial Sideband (VSB) modulation, Frequency Translation, Frequency Division Multiplexing, Super-heterodyne Receiver
Principles of Angle modulation, Frequency and Phase modulation
Modulation and Demodulation of FM signals, Phase Locked Loops(PLLs), Applications of FM, Narrow Band FM signals, Wide Band FM signal
Random Processes, Wide Sense Stationary(WSS) processes, Power spectral Density, Gaussian Processes
Pulse code modulation, Differential Pulse code modulation
Threshold effect in FM

**Feedback on Lectures:**

The course was taught in the CDEEP recording room at the 4th floor of the GG building. The lectures were regularly recorded and put up on the CDEEP website. Because of this, we were able to cover up if we missed some classes. The professor’s way of teaching is very systematic and he explains the intuition behind stuff really well. He tries to be as exact with the math as he can without complicating it for the students. The lectures were fun to attend and the instructor covered almost all of the prescribed syllabus systematically

**Feedback on Tutorials, Assignments and Exams:**

There were no assignments given in this course. Regular tutorials were provided and it is highly advised to solve them by beforehand since there were in-tutorial quizzes that had basically questions directly from the tutorial sheet. Also, many questions in the quizzes and mid semester exam were very similar to the ones in the tutorials.

There were 2 quizzes and mid semester exam which were easy but the end semester was moderate in difficulty level.

**Weightage and Grading:**

The grading announced initially was as follows:

Endsem Exam – 50%

Midsem Exam – 30%

Quizzes(each) – 10%

But this grading should have gotten changed because there was no mention of tutorial quizzes in this weightage system. And the final weightages were not disclosed.

**Study Material and References:**

Taking notes during the class will help in preparing for exam. The slides provided by the professor and the videos on the CDEEP website were more than enough for preparing for the exams. The reference books can be studied if you want to delve more deeply into the subject matter.

**Additional comments & what you learnt from the course:**

The course serves as an introduction course for someone inclined towards control theory.
