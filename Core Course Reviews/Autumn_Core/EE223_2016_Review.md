### EE 223 - Data Analysis and Interpretation






**Course offered in:**


Autumn 2016


**Instructors:**


Prof. Prasanna Chaporkar


**Motivation behind the course:**
This course is positioned as the Fundamental Course for Introducing Probability and Statistics.
Analyzing data and interpreting results are integral part of almost every Research and it finds extensive use in Industry as well.From Machine learning to Finance, its applications are enormous.


**Course Content:**
Probability (Conditional and Bayes Theorem),Random Variables,Probability Distribution of Random Variables,Chebyshev’s Inequalities,Weak Law of Large Numbers,Central Limit Theorem,Moment Generating Functions,Independent and Identically Distributed Variables (IIDs),Joint Distribution,Hypothesis Testing,Linear Regression(very basic)
**Prerequisites:**
The course officially has no Prerequisite. Basic knowledge of JEE level probability and statistics would be of help though.
**Feedback on Lectures:**


First few minutes of every lecture were dedicated to Revision of the previous lecture. The lectures were most of the times interesting with the instructor having given clear thought about the content of the Lecture beforehand.The Instructor was interactive and as the course involves some difficult to grasp concepts, several students posed regular doubts to the Instructor who was more than willing to get them cleared then and there. Though the overall review of the Instructor might vary from person to person depending upon his/her experience and parameters of judging(which might be biased due to the exams), the Instructor made the course interesting and at the same time challenging as well,
CAUTION: The Instructor does not use any Lecture Slides and it is extremely important that you pay attention in his class and making (or getting) class notes is highly recommended. 
**Feedback on Tutorials, Assignments and Exams:**


The Instructor at the start of the session had announced 5 Quizzes, each of 20 marks  as the Evaluation pattern but had later changed to 6 Quizzes, 20 Marks Each.Best 5 out of the 6 quizzes were taken into account for Final Grading
The course was very notorious for its difficult Quizzes which were quite mathematical and heavily based on application of the theory.It is due to the experiences of the initial Quizzes that the class had decided to propose the Best 5 out of 6 scheme tothe Instructor.




**Difficulty:**
9/10.
The course is rated on the difficult side of the spectrum taking into account the experience of the majority of the batch who found the exams quite a bit to handle. It was also observed that the Instructor taught some portion of the consequent course EE325 in this Introductory course itself which perhaps might be the reason.
