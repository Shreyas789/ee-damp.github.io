### EE 308 – Communication Systems

**Course offered in:**

Autumn 2016

**Instructors:**

Instructor – Prof. Bikash K. Dey (For EE B.Tech)

**Motivation:**
This is the first course in the communication domain at IIT Bombay. This course will give an introduction to the fundamentals of analog communication, digital communication, information theory & coding and today’s wireless technology and most importantly, sets a base for all the communication courses you will pursue in future.

**Course Content:**

The topics covered in this course are as follows –

1) Principles of analog modulation, modulation and demodulation of AM, DSBSC, SSB signals and their practical applications.
2) Principles of angle modulation, frequency and phase modulation
3) Narrow and wide band FM, generation and demodulation of FM signals, phase locked loops, application of FM.
4) Sampling and quantization of band-limited signals.


**Feedback on Lectures:**


The instructor taught the course material on the board during the lectures and later provided similar study material on moodle. The instructor is strict about the attendance and can give an FR if he feels that the attendance is below a certain threshold (decided by him). Paying attention in class is advised since it makes preparation for exams easier.

Feedback on Tutorials, Assignments and Exams:

There were no assignments given in this course. Regular homeworks were provided and it is highly advised to solve them by hand since many questions in the quizzes and mid semester exam were very similar to the ones in the homeworks.   

There were 2 quizzes and mid semester exam which were easy but the end semester was moderate in difficulty level. Every exam was based on the material discussed in class.

**Difficulty:**



The course was easy before Midsem. The next part of the course was difficult or fast paced.



**Weightage:**


Quizzes – 25% (12% + 13%)

Midsem – 25%

Endsem – 50%

Grading difficult or chill is personal opinion. I found it easy. Check for yourself



**Study Material and References:**

Taking notes during the class will help in preparing for exam. If not taken, make sure to refer to the study material which the instructor uploaded after class.

Not a necessity but I would suggest to go through the reference textbooks once during the course. They greatly help in better understanding of the concepts taught in the course.  

Reference Textbooks :-
