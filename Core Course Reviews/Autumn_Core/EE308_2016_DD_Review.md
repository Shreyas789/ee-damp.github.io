### EE 308 – COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS


**Course offered in:**

Autumn 2016

**Instructors:**

Prof. D. Manjunath

**Motivation behind the course:**

This course gives an introduction of the varied applications of ideas learnt in the Signals and Systems course.

**Course Content:**

• Review of Signals and Systems

• Types and subtypes of modulation (Amplitude, angle, phase, frequency)

• Transmission and reception systems, PLL, synchronisation

• Effects of noise and ways to counter them, Introductory random processes

• Sampling and quantisation

• Multiplexing

• Common applications (Radio, television, wireline phone, cellular phone)



**Prerequisites:**

EE 210 (Signals and systems)

**Feedback on Lectures:**

The professor laid huge emphasis on the ideas rather than the mathematical details. The material regarding basic concepts and formulations closely followed Haykin’s ‘Introduction to Analog and Digital Communications’. The instructor highlighted many practical aspects regarding implementation which was hard to find at a single source, especially during the common applications part.

**Feedback on Tutorials, Assignments and Exams:**

• Surprise quizzes – 20%

• Midsem – 30%

• Endsem – 50%

Surprise quizzes were directly given from homework questions. So, make it a point to do the homework and attend lectures. The exams generally had an incresing level of difficulty in regard to the questions. Practising from the book is helpful.



**Study Material and References:**

• S. S. Haykin, “An Introduction to Analog and Digital Communication Systems” John Wiley & Sons

• B. P. Lathi, “Modern Digital and Analog Communication Systems” Oxford University Press
