### EE 308 – COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (DD)


**Course offered in:**

Autumn 2017

**Instructors:**

Prof. Shalabh Gupta

**Motivation behind the course:**

This course gives an introduction of the varied applications of ideas learnt in the Signals and Systems course.

**Course Content:**
Review of signals and systems
Amplitude modulation
Frequency modulation
Noise in AM and FM
PAM & PCM
Quantization
Most parts of chapters 1 to 3 of the book Communication Systems (4th edition) by Simon Haykin

**Prerequisites:**

EE 210 (Signals and systems)

**Feedback on Lectures:**

The lectures are difficult to follow because the instructor doesn’t mention many small details while teaching. However, he insisted on 80% attendance with DX and grade penalties for missing more than 3 classes. However, no such action was taken in the end.

However, one can grasp the concepts well if they follow any of the books by Simon Haykin. The course progresses at a fast pace and to understand the content well, it is necessary to follow the book on a regular basis.


**Feedback on Tutorials, Assignments and Exams:**

Tutorial sheets were uploaded after a topic got covered in the class. The solutions were discussed by the professor or the TAs. The tutorials did help in improving the understanding of the content.

The evaluation breakdown is given below –

      Surprise quizzes – 30%
      Mid Semester Exam – 30%
      End Semester Exam – 40%
The surprise quizzes were conducted after the professor had a covered a topic in the class. The questions were objective (fill in the blanks and MCQs) and had questions based on what the professor had taught in the class. The quizzes were on the easier side and the professor gave enough time (around 30 minutes) to attempt them.

The mid semester and end semester exams were a little difficult. It will be helpful if one could practice some questions from the book. There were some concepts and ideas not covered in the class but mentioned in the book and they did show up in the exams.

**Difficulty:**

Moderate

**Grading:**

The grading statistics were similar for both sections. Please check on asc for exact statistics.
