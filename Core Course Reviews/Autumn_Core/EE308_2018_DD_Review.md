### EE 308 – COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (DD)


**Course offered in:**

2017-18

**Instructors:**

Prof. Shabbir Merchant

**Motivation behind the course:**

This course serves an introduction to the concepts required for implementation of digital communication systems. This course is of utmost importance for those of you who want to shape their careers in the direction of communication engineering, as well as for those who want to pursue research in the field of communications. It will help you get acquainted with the basics required to undertake advanced courses and projects in this field. Even for those of you are who are interested in finance or High frequency trading, this course covers some important concepts like fourier transforms and advanced statistics which are very useful in these areas too. This course is mainly focussed on analog signal communication, and starts off with a primer on fourier transforms, and then talks about different modulation schemes and their performance under noise considerations. ( Noise statistics and gaussian processes were covered in detail for the same).

**Course Content:**

Review of Fourier Transforms
Power spectral density and autocorrelation
Amplitude and angle modulation schemes
Random Processes and noise representation ( AWGN model and gaussian process)
Pulse modulation, DPCM, Quantization
Performance of modulation schemes


**Prerequisites:**

There are no prerequisites as such, but concepts covered in EE 210 and EE 223 are helpful for this course. EE 308 is a course prerequisite for EE328, which is in turn is a prerequisite for many department electives in the field of communication.

**Feedback on Lectures:**

Lectures were quite systematic, and well elucidated. The video lectures were available on cdeep as well. The course content was mostly based on a standard text book. Video lectures and slides were helpful in the end (at the time of exams). The attendance was not compulsory as such, but the professor made sure that people attended the tutorials compulsorily, especially towards the end of the course.

**Feedback on Tutorials, Assignments and Exams:**

Professor gave one coding assignment, which was to be submitted after the end sem. He regularly posted tutorials, which were helpful in clearing concepts and solving problems. He took 4 surprise quizzes (mostly surprise for namesake), which were based on tutorial problems and were conducted in the tutorial slots. Following the lectures and tutorials regularly, as well as going through the lecture slides and solving problems from the book was sufficient to do well in the course.

Advanced courses and applications of this course in future:

EE708 -Information theory and coding, EE 764 -wireless networks and EE 608 – Adaptive Signal Processing would be interesting courses to take up in future if you enjoyed this course.
